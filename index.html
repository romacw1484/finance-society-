            The Fordham Society is New York Universityâ€™s premier professional, social, and academic organization devoted to the financial services industry. Through our general meetings and various programs, we educate our members on accounting and valuation techniques and help them achieve excellence in the classroom, the community, and in the workplace. We understand that the business environment is competitive and volatile, so we are constantly improving to meet the growing demands of recruiters and employers of finance, along with fostering a tight-knit community of smart, passionate leaders. As one of the largest student-run organizations at Stern, we warmly welcome all NYU students to attend our numerous events during the semester. We look forward to meeting you at one of our upcoming events!
